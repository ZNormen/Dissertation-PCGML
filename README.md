# Enhancing Controllability in Procedurally Generated Levels using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Algorithms

This is my dissertation for Babes-Bolyai University, Faculty of Economics (FSEGA), specialty of Business Modeling and Distributed Computing.
Developed an LSTM-based neural network for generating playable platformer game levels with a focus on sequence generation and level structure integrity, 
conducted experiments to evaluate the impact of different parameter settings on model performance, 
and highlighted the need for further experimentation to improve the generation of complex game structures.


## Abstract
This research paper aims to compare and evaluate different, procedurally generated Super Mario Bros. (1985) levels. 
The study focuses on addressing the research question of "How can the implementation of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithms enhance controllability in the procedural generation of video game levels?". 
The research explores the performance of a Long Short-Term Memory model, providing insights into its performance across metrics such as accuracy, efficiency, interpretability, and generalization, with a focus on generating Super Mario Bros. levels. 
The conclusions drawn from the analysis contribute to the field of video game development, facilitating greater control and customization in level design processes.
